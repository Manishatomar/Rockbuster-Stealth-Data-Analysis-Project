## Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project
#### Introduction
In this project, I was brought on by Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a traditional movie rental company, to develop a data strategy for the launch of their new online video rental service. The company, which once operated stores worldwide, is now facing significant competition from streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. My role involves leveraging SQL to analyze various data points, ultimately providing the Rockbuster Stealth management team with data-driven insights to inform their 2020 launch strategy and help the company remain competitive in the evolving market.
This project centers on utilizing SQL for comprehensive data analysis to answer department-specific queries, thereby improving decision-making for the upcoming transition to an online service. The skills gained through this experience are highly transferable across industries, highlighting my strong problem-solving capabilities in data analytics.
#### Key Questions
Which movies are pivotal for revenue?
Average rental duration for videos?
Demographics of Rockbuster customers?
Location of high-value customers?
Sales comparison across regions.

#### Data Set: 
The dataset includes information on Rockbusterâ€™s film inventory, customers, and transactions, loaded into a PostgreSQL database. It's structured to reflect real-world business scenarios and relationships between different data tables.
